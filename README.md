### Surfs-Up Challenge

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to compare the statistical temperature data for both the summer (June) and winter (Dec),
in order to determine the feasibility of an ice cream shop catered to surfers. This analysis is for the island of Oahu, a 
part of the state of Hawaii. 

## Results

-The statistical summary of the data for both months is relatively close in value. 
-There will be no substantial potential loss of money in the winter months, if temperature is the only metric we use.
-June has a higher temperature in every category, but not by enough of a margin to matter. 

## Summary 

I do not believe that we have performed enough queries to make a concrete decision on a year-round shop. The temperature 
data from June and December is too similar to make any decision based on that alone. A query for the precipitation during 
those specific months would be helpful. A query to determine the water quality during these months would also be helpful. A
comparison of multiple metrics should be used here, in order to make a more informed decision.
